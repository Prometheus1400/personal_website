# Personal Website

A minimalist, fast, and mobile-friendly personal website built with vanilla HTML, Tailwind CSS, and HTMX.

## Features

- ⚡ **No build step** — pure HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript
- 📱 **Fully responsive** — looks great on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- 🎨 **Modern design** — clean dark theme with amber accents
- 🔄 **SPA-like navigation** — smooth page transitions via HTMX
- 🏎️ **Fast** — minimal dependencies, no heavy frameworks

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** — Semantic markup
- **Tailwind CSS** — Utility-first styling (via CDN)
- **HTMX** — Dynamic content loading without page refreshes
- **Inter** — Clean, modern typeface from Google Fonts

## Local Development

Since this uses Tailwind CDN, just open `index.html` in a browser:

```bash
# Or use a simple server
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Then visit http://localhost:8000
```

## Deployment

This site is designed to be deployed on any static hosting:
- GitHub Pages
- Vercel
- Netlify
- Any web server

                Hello it's great to meet you! My name is Kaleb Dickerson and I am currently a junior Software Engineer at Apple in Austin, Texas.
                I'm very passionate about software and programming (unfortunately frontend is not my forte so DON'T visit this site on mobile).
                Right now I'm very into Neovim and terminal based workflows, there's just something about spamming a mechanical keyboard and seeing stuff get done!
                I'm also very interested in programming languages and their implementations as well as compilers and interpreters (JITs are insane!!).
            </p>
            <p class="opacity-0 transition-opacity duration-1000 fade-in">
            Outside of work you can usually find me at the gym. I love bodybuilding, both the sport and the activity, and I even have a fitness page which you can check out <a class="text-orange-300 hover:text-blue-700 underline" href="https://www.instagram.com/kalebdickerson_fit?igsh=MWpsZ3EzY205dDUyeQ%3D%3D&utm_source=qr">here</a>.
                I'll post some new content eventually...
                I'm also an avid fantasy reader, if you've never heard of The Stormlight Archives series by Brandon Sanderson you're missing out.
